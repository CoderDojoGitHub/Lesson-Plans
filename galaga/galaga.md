[Galaga](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galaga) is a classic arcade game that first appeared in 1979, as a sequal to Galaxian. The goal of the game is to pilot your space ship, shooting down flying aliens, while avoiding their missiles. Desispite being relased 33 years ago, Galaga and similar spinoffs are still popular, appearing on smartphones and Xbox Live Arcade.

This tutorial teaches you how to build a simplified version of Galaga. You'll need a copy of the lite version of GameMaker.
