# What this repo is used for
We use this repository largely to track our events that we doing, and planning for those
events. You can see these happening over in [the issues](https://github.com/CoderDojoSF/Lesson-Plans/issues)
list. This is also a great place to find out how you can help the [CoderDojo](http://coderdojo.com) movement.

## How you can become involved
There's excellent information at <http://coderdojo.com/> about starting a dojo and getting
involved. If you'd like to help out our specific dojo, it would be great to [file an issue](https://github.com/CoderDojoSF/Lesson-Plans/issues/new)
and introduce yourself and communicate with us about our next session, signing up and attending
frequently, or contributing back to our repos. Also take a look at [CONTRIBUTING.MD](https://github.com/CoderDojoSF/Lesson-Plans/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)
for more tips.

## How you can get started creating a lesson
Many of our projects are great examples of how we start lessons. For more information, 
take a look throughout our projects, some of which are:
* [Networking](https://github.com/CoderDojoSF/networking)
* [Tic Tac Toe](https://github.com/CoderDojoSF/tic-tac-toe)
* [Memory](https://github.com/CoderDojoSF/memory)
